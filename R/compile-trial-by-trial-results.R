#' Compiles a data frame of trial-by-trial results for each participant.

#' MDT results on a trial-by-trial level.
#' @param in_dir Results directory to process.
#' @param label Label that the MDT's results were saved under (typically "MDT").
#' @param combine Whether to combine results into one big data frame,
#' or instead to return a list of data frames, one for each participant.
#' @return A data frame, or list of data frames, of trial-by-trial results.
